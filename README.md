# Quantile-Regression-of-Survey-Data
This repository has all the R functions assoicated with our paper "Quantile regression analysis of survey data under informative sampling" authored by Dr. Sixia Chen and Dr. Yan Daniel Zhao, accepted to appear in The Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology.

Here is a detailed description of the files:
1. Functions.R.  This file contains all the six quantile regression estimators discussed in the paper, including DW, UOPT, SDW, PS, SPS, and SOPT.  The file also contains a boot function that computes the quantile regression estimators, confidence intervals, and the bootstrap variance.
2. Example.R.  This file contains a Sample function that simulates a dataset and example codes of using the functions in the Functions.R file.
